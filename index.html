 <h2 id="post10">Post 10: Coding Every Day Challenge</h2>
        <h6>Monday, June 1st</h6>
        
       
<p>For all of March and April I pretty much coded every day... although I feel I basically just ticked off boxes. I could've worked a LOT harder, tbh.   I lost a little bit of steam when there was a glitch in KA and it didn't record a couple of my days of coding -- sooo sad!! I admit, that shouldn't have been enough to stop me from coding EVERY day-- I should be able to know <em>for myself</em> that I am reaching my goals, but I am definitely one of those students who loves to see the gold star and the "A+'s" -- visual indicators are just sooo motivating for me.  But anyhow, I'm going to renew my code-every-day goal (longest was around 50 days, I believe!) but this time I'm going to up my game.  I'm going to shoot for the github, KA, AND FCC visuals.  I want every one of those blocks on FCC and github to be filled in. </p>
<p>Actually, it would be really cool if I could show those visuals on my blog... I'll have to figure out if I can host pictures on github somehow?  That's probably possible -- but I'll get back to you ;) </p>  
<p>UPDATE: The solution is really easy, actually! I can put the images on google photos and then link to them.  Woohoo!</p>

<p>Hmm... looking at the FCC tracker above, I know that I can DEFINITELY do more.  I feel I have learned so much, but I only coded on FCC for 15 days... on those days I finished the entire CSS & HTML "Responsive Web Design" course, as well as the Basic Javascript course and a good chunk of the rest of the Javascript cert course. I know that if I can stick to coding EVERY day, I can do a LOT more! </p>

 <h2 id="post9">Post 9: Tribute Page</h2>
        <h6>Monday, June 1st</h6>
        
       
<p>It's been a while since I updated this blog, oops... However, I've still been coding in the meantime!  Although I deviated a little from my "goals" list, I have completed some of the tasks, and added/completed others. I suppose goals naturally update/change as I learn more about the task ahead of me and web dev in general! </p>
<p>Anyway, I completed the KA CSS/HTML course long ago, in April, I believe, and then I completed the Free Code Camp "Responsive Web Design" course.  It would have been wise to do the projects of the course right after I finished, but instead I skipped those and went on to the Javascript course.  Now I've finally come back to the CSS projects and they're probably quite a bit more challenging than they would have been if I hadn't basically stopped using CSS for the month of May and focused on jQuery and Javascript... </p>
<p>Lessons learned, I suppose.  Anyway, I went back and worked on the portfolio projects, and project 1 is done!  I've made a tribute page to Lynn Hill, badass female climber.  You can view that below.  I do still need to figure out how to pass the last "test" of the tribute page.... I am getting an alert that the image doesn't responsively resize, even though it DOES resize. I think the test wants me to solve the problem in a specific way, but I feel that I have come up with at least one solution, which is why I'm sharing it now.  I'll update the blog when I manage to pass the test. UPDATE: after getting some hints from folks on the Free Code Camp forum, I was able to pass all the tests!</p> 
<p> Oh!  Also in the past month and a half I've been making videos of the Khan Academy challenges that I complete!  I finished the "Making Webpages Interactive with JS" course, and also the JQuery course... I am still working on recording the final JQuery challenges, but the entire series can be viewed on my youtube account, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/okdora/videos?view_as=subscriber">here</a>.  Onward and upward!</p>

<h2 id="post8">Post 8: rabbit racer challenge</h2>
<h6>Friday, April 10th, 2020</h6>
        
       
<p> I finished the below challenge today!  WebDev teachers are very silly, no?</p>
<p><strong>Please note </strong>that most of the code in this program is not mine.  Khan Academy gives you little challenges where they ask you to add or change two or 3 steps to existing code.  My job in this challenge was to add a button and the functionality that allows the user to click and move the far right rabbit forward.  All the other code was already written. </p>
<p>Then why did I share the program?  Because I'm proud of that one button and how fast the rabbit can run!  Very, very proud!</p>

        <h2 id="post7">Post 7: CSS at Free Code Camp</h2>
        <h6>Thursday, April 9th, 2020</h6>
        
        <p> Yesterday (after I wrote my blog post) I managed to embed some Javascript on GitHub (you can see that in my last post!) and after that I worked a little bit more on the Adv. JS course, and also started a CSS course at Free Code Camp.  I like their exercises because they are standalone and easy to do one at a time, which I think is a good introduction to a lot of tags and "functionality" I wasn't exposed to during the KA CSS & HTML course.  It's nice to do when my brain is sort of processing the JS logic that I'm trying to learn in the Advanced JS program (which, let's face it, sometimes take a while!!!). </p>
        <p> I've been talking to a good friend of mine on (my old boss!) who is also a highly creative person and technically skilled as well.  He is currently doing an MFA in writing BUT shared with me an app he created over Christmas break.  It's quite a useful, concise app, and so inspiring to see another creative person who also taught himself how to code,  doing some really interesting, technical things.  I am inspired to do my own stuff even more... I might resurrect my idea to do make a roommate to-do app.  In fact, I think I might just design a simple to-do app... first it would be fun to do just the research and design of it (and put it in my UX portfolio) but then at some point maybe I could even try just coding it!  That would be a really fun project, to make my own app.  I've thought about doing it before, but seeing my friend's great work is very encouraging!!! </p> 
        
        I still need to do my animation for today -- I'll make sure to post that when I do, but I also wanted to embed this interactive animation I finished earlier this week:

  <h2 id="post5">Post 5: More interactive Illustrations!</h2>
        <h6>Wednesday, April 8th, 2020</h6>
        <p> Yesterday I tried to go give blood, but they sent me home as I had a temperature of 99.6, which is apparently the cut-off!  I wanted to help with the coronavirus and blood shortage (there is soon to be a huge one due to the pandemic) but I am sick, I guess!! It's weird because I've only seen a very limited number of family members (who are also all working from home) for the last month and a half, and for two weeks of that I was pretty much in complete quarantine.  It'll definitely be a testament to the HIGHLY contagious nature of this virus if I am sick with it.   I feel fine so far, though! </p>
        <p> Anyway, so far today I have done more work on the Advanced JavaScript Animations course (I learned more about making buttons) and this morning I also edited an old animation (where gems fall on the screen when a user presses the mouse) so that now you need to press a BUTTON to make the gems fall.  I also evaluated some other users' projects on KA and submitted another help request!  </p>
        <p> Now I have transferred over this blog to github entirely, and I am going to start trying to embed my projects from KA here, and build an actual website for my portfolio AND coding projects.  Woohoo!!! That'll be crazy and cool to ACTUALLY deploy a real website, that I made all by my lonesome.  Oh, I also found a better photoshop series to watch, although it's not going to be QUITE as good, just because it's one long 3 hour video, rather than little short videos that are easier to reference.  But whatever.  I feel confident that I'm making progress. :) 
        <br>
        <p> Edit: Wow, it turns out that not having the "Oh Noes" guy in the KA environment makes coding & finding errors a lot trickier!  Adding this one, little, simple blog post in Github was actually a little time consuming, just because I had to hunt down the 3 or so teeny tiny typos I made.  I'mma hafta figure out what to do to make error handling & debugging code easier.  
      
        <h2 id="post4">Post 4: Began Advanced JS Course</h2>
        <h6>Tuesday, April 7th, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>Yesterday I managed to animate one of my old programs: the loopiing practice program with the house.  I made leaves fall when clicked!  I also got my first help request answered by another KA member: very cool.  </p>
        
        <p>I'm continutally impressed by the level of the coursework on KA, as well as the community.  I also started the photoshop course (free) on UDEMY yesterday and it was.... not great.  The pacing is too slow and redundant about easy, intuitive concepts, but then goes too quickly over new, useful information!  That's fine -- it's free, right?  But compare that to Pamela's courses on computer programming on KA... it's possible to have free training that is also high quality!  And I have proof! ;P </p> 
        
        <p> Speaking about paywalls, and such... I discovered that my Squarespace account doesn't allow me to embed JS (I was trying to embed some of the animations I made onto my portfolio page) even though I pay $15/month or so for that site!!!!???!!!! They allow normal paying members to embed CSS and HTML, but not JS. That's for BUSINESS members only, apparently (hard eye roll).</p>
        
        <p>Since I can code, though, I guess I no longer need a site like Squarespace to host my portfolio... I can just build my site my self!!! Onward and upward! </p>
    

        <br><br>
        <h2 id="post3">Post 3: Finished CSS/HTML </h2>
        <h6>Monday, April 6th, 2020</h6>
        
        <p> I finished the CSS/HTML course yesterday.  Whereas the Javascript Course took 3 weeks, this one took 3 days. ; ) <br><br>
        I'm feeling a leeeeetle bit lost without the goal of just rampaging through a course as fast as possible.  I went back and edited my "house" project from the JS course this morning so that it has some simple animation, and I submitted my first "help request," so that was good, but now I know I reaaaaallly should work on my portfolio.  My S.O. and I chatted last night about how it's great that I'm working on "upskilling," (yeuch, what an "industry term")  but I really need to make sure to keep applying for jobs.  He also reminded me (and I already knew this, but it's good to hear it again, especially from a developer) that certifications and such are fine and all, but seeing what a designer can do is really what he looks for when hiring someone.  Sigh.  Can't I just take multiple choice tests foreeeeevveeeeerrrrrrrrr???? Lol. 
    <br> <br> 
    Okay, okay.  So today my goal is to hit the Photoshop course I'm taking on Udemy, hard.  And also apply for my "two jobs/day."  I want to work on the photoshop course because though I know I am competent with it already, it would be a huge boost to my confidence as a designer to have actually gone through a course, end-to-end.  Working through the Sketch course I did felt really good, and when I finished it, I felt much less like I was just masquerading as a UX designer.  
    
    <br> <br> 
    
    I will also work on adding the coding that I've done to my portfolio site.  It would be great if I added it as a separate page... with the animations that I've done embedded there.  
    
    <br> <br> 
    
    I did my one animation for today, so hopefully I can keep that up!  Wouldn't it be cool if, when someone visited my website, they could see each small animation I do everyday... and look at how much I've improved? :  )
    <br> <br> 

        <h2 id="post2">Post 2: Goals</h2>
        <h6>Saturday, April  4th - 2020</h6>

            </ul>
       
        
        <h2 id="post1">I'm starting a programming blog! </h2>
        <h6>Saturday, April  4th - 2020</h6>
        
        <p>Today, I started a programming blog to document my programming & web design journey on Khan Academy...and beyond!  So far I've completed the Intro to Javascript course (I finally finished on Wednesday -- it took me 3 weeks!)  and now I'm about 3/4 of the way done with the HTML & CSS course.  After that, I'm going to do the HTML & Javascript course, and eventually, the Advanced Javascript course.   
         
             
        <br>
        <br> 
        
        I also want to continue working  on my goal of "making the piggy tap his foot." Let me explain. ; ) 
        
        <br> <br> 
        For one of my first programming challenges, I drew a piggy.  It turned out the drawing I made was a BIT too complicated for the problem I was trying to solve, so I started over and animated a much simpler animal, but I kept the piggy and his code, in hopes that <em>later</em> I'd be able to make him dance! Even though I finished the Intro to Javascript course, I still haven't reached my goal.  That's another of my projects that I'm going to keep working on <em>while</em>  finishing this HTML/CSS course.
