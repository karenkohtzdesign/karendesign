                <li>Work through Adobe XD Course on Udemy</li>
                <li>Complete a daily simple illustration using JS</li>
                <li>Begin youtube series where I redesign things that annoy me on the web (primarily using Sketch and Axure). </li>

                <li>Finally finish that interactive costume I designed with capacitive sensors and sound loops, using an arduino or teensy.  
            </ul>
       
        
        <h2 id="post1">I'm starting a programming blog! </h2>
        <h6>Saturday, April  4th - 2020</h6>
        
        <p>Today, I started a programming blog to document my programming & web design journey on Khan Academy...and beyond!  So far I've completed the Intro to Javascript course (I finally finished on Wednesday -- it took me 3 weeks!)  and now I'm about 3/4 of the way done with the HTML & CSS course.  After that, I'm going to do the HTML & Javascript course, and eventually, the Advanced Javascript course.   
         
             
        <br>
        <br> 
        
        I also want to continue working  on my goal of "making the piggy tap his foot." Let me explain. ; ) 
        
        <br> <br> 
        For one of my first programming challenges, I drew a piggy.  It turned out the drawing I made was a BIT too complicated for the problem I was trying to solve, so I started over and animated a much simpler animal, but I kept the piggy and his code, in hopes that <em>later</em> I'd be able to make him dance! Even though I finished the Intro to Javascript course, I still haven't reached my goal.  That's another of my projects that I'm going to keep working on <em>while</em>  finishing this HTML/CSS course. 
         </p>
