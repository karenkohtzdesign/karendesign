        <h2 id="post34">Post # 4: Began Advanced JS Course</h2>
        <h6>Tuesday, April 7th, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>Yesterday I managed to animate one of my old programs: the loopiing practice program with the house.  I made leaves fall when clicked!  I also got my first help request answered by another KA member: very cool.  </p>
        
        <p>I'm continutally impressed by the level of the coursework on KA, as well as the community.  I also started the photoshop course (free) on UDEMY yesterday and it was.... not great.  The pacing is too slow and redundant about easy, intuitive concepts, but then goes too quickly over new, useful information!  That's fine -- it's free, right?  But compare that to Pamela's courses on computer programming on KA... it's possible to have free training that is also high quality!  And I have proof! ;P </p> 
        
        <p> Speaking about paywalls, and such... I discovered that my Squarespace account doesn't allow me to embed JS (I was trying to embed some of the animations I made onto my portfolio page) even though I pay $15/month or so for that site!!!!???!!!! They allow normal paying members to embed CSS and HTML, but not JS. That's for BUSINESS members only, apparently (hard eye roll).</p>
        
        <p>Since I can code, though, I guess I no longer need a site like Squarespace to host my portfolio... I can just build my site my self!!! Onward and upward! </p>

        <h2 id="post3">Post # 3: Finished CSS/HTML </h2>
        <h6>Monday, April 6th, 2020</h6>
        
        <p> I finished the CSS/HTML course yesterday.  Whereas the Javascript Course took 3 weeks, this one took 3 days. ; ) <br><br>
        I'm feeling a leeeeetle bit lost without the goal of just rampaging through a course as fast as possible.  I went back and edited my "house" project from the JS course this morning so that it has some simple animation, and I submitted my first "help request," so that was good, but now I know I reaaaaallly should work on my portfolio.  My S.O. and I chatted last night about how it's great that I'm working on "upskilling," (yeuch, what an "industry term")  but I really need to make sure to keep applying for jobs.  He also reminded me (and I already knew this, but it's good to hear it again, especially from a developer) that certifications and such are fine and all, but seeing what a designer can do is really what he looks for when hiring someone.  Sigh.  Can't I just take multiple choice tests foreeeeevveeeeerrrrrrrrr???? Lol. 
    <br> <br> 
    Okay, okay.  So today my goal is to hit the Photoshop course I'm taking on Udemy, hard.  And also apply for my "two jobs/day."  I want to work on the photoshop course because though I know I am competent with it already, it would be a huge boost to my confidence as a designer to have actually gone through a course, end-to-end.  Working through the Sketch course I did felt really good, and when I finished it, I felt much less like I was just masquerading as a UX designer.  
    
    <br> <br> 
    
    I will also work on adding the coding that I've done to my portfolio site.  It would be great if I added it as a separate page... with the animations that I've done embedded there.  
    
    <br> <br> 
    
    I did my one animation for today, so hopefully I can keep that up!  Wouldn't it be cool if, when someone visited my website, they could see each small animation I do everyday... and look at how much I've improved? :  )

        <h2 id="post2">Post # 2: Goals</h2>
        <h6>Saturday, April  4th - 2020</h6>
        
        <p> I'm still working on some of my skills for UX design and on sprucing up my portfolio, as well as learning new programming skills.  My goals, for both UX Design & Programming, are as follows: </p>  
            <ul> 
                <li>Complete CSS/HTML course on KA</li>
                <li>Review/work through Photoshop Course on Udemy</li>

                <li>Complete a daily simple illustration using JS</li>
                <li>Begin youtube series where I redesign things that annoy me on the web (primarily using Sketch and Axure). </li>
                <li>Pass LinkedIn HTML Exam </li>
                <li>Pass LinkedIn CSS Exam  </li>
                <li>Pass LinkedIn JavaScript Exam </li>

                <li>Finally finish that interactive costume I designed with capacitive sensors and sound loops, using an arduino or teensy.  
            </ul>
       
        
        <h2 id="post1">I'm starting a programming blog! </h2>
        <h6>Saturday, April  4th - 2020</h6>
        
        <p>Today, I started a programming blog to document my programming & web design journey on Khan Academy...and beyond!  So far I've completed the Intro to Javascript course (I finally finished on Wednesday -- it took me 3 weeks!)  and now I'm about 3/4 of the way done with the HTML & CSS course.  After that, I'm going to do the HTML & Javascript course, and eventually, the Advanced Javascript course.   
         
             
        <br>
        <br> 
        
        I also want to continue working  on my goal of "making the piggy tap his foot." Let me explain. ; ) 
        
        <br> <br> 
        For one of my first programming challenges, I drew a piggy.  It turned out the drawing I made was a BIT too complicated for the problem I was trying to solve, so I started over and animated a much simpler animal, but I kept the piggy and his code, in hopes that <em>later</em> I'd be able to make him dance! Even though I finished the Intro to Javascript course, I still haven't reached my goal.  That's another of my projects that I'm going to keep working on <em>while</em>  finishing this HTML/CSS course.
